# Frifim

> Simplified financial management. Check out beta version: https://frifim.com/

## Setting up for core development

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app),
using the [Redux](https://redux.js.org/) and [Redux Toolkit](https://redux-toolkit.js.org/) template.

### Installing dependencies

With Node 12 installed and `yarn` globally available, clone the project and inside its directory run:

```sh
yarn
```

### Hosting Firebase instance

Ideally you'll use your own Firebase for that, it's free.
So start taking a look on [how to setup Firebase for web](https://firebase.google.com/docs/web/setup).

From your project, once you have created your Firestore Database and
your Firebase Web App, you'll have your own `firebaseConfig` data in hands.
Create a `.env.local` file using `.env` as example. Like doing this:

```sh
cp .env .env.local
```

So then open your `.env.local` and put your Firebase config data there. This file won't be versioned,
it's ignored by git, so you won't need to share your own data while contributing.

### Hosting local web app

Runs the app in the development mode:

```sh
yarn start
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits. You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### Some more Firebase operations

A few more steps to finish your initial Firebase setup. In your console:

1. Authentication -> Sign-in method: enable at least the "e-mail/password" mode.
2. Cloud Firestore -> Rules: if you're planning to store real data,
secure it with a few rules.
3. While running the app, during your first queries, a few browser console errors may show up,
requiring the creation of indexes on the database. Just follow the link provided by the
warning (and wait a few minutes).


### Fixture data

This part is optional.

When you are logged in on your own Frifim instance, open the browser console
and call once `persistFixtures()` and wait for a messaging saying that a commit
was sent. Refresh the page, this is important too. Now you'll see that a few
data was registered for you as a demonstration.

## Contributing

Open [an issue](https://github.com/Mazuh/frifim/issues) describing how you're
planning to contribute, even plain ideas or clueless bug reports are very 
good contributions. Then we can check the doable viability (cause Firebase
is nice and free but limited), before any hard work.

## Deploying

For service administrators. Prepare the static dist folder:

```js
yarn build
```

## What does Frifim mean?

In a short answer: **fr**ee **i**ndependent **fi**nancial **m**anagement.

More importantly, it's a funny word available to be registered as a domain.

This "free" stands for the freedom of free source projects, but I'll also try
my best to keep it at no costs for end users, even when significant expenses appear.
