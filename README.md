# Frifim

> Simplified financial management. Check out beta version: https://frifim.com/

## Setting up for core development

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app),
using the [Redux](https://redux.js.org/) and [Redux Toolkit](https://redux-toolkit.js.org/) template.

### Installing dependencies

With Node 14, clone the project and inside its directory run:

```sh
npm install
```

### Hosting Firebase instance

Ideally you'll use your own Firebase for that, it's free.
So start taking a look on [how to setup Firebase for web](https://firebase.google.com/docs/web/setup).
In case you don't want to read it, just access Firebase page and try to create a new project, it's
just a bunch of "next, next, next" steps.

As hints while creating the Firebase project, remember to choose choices like "development mode"
(so the database will be totally free for writing/reading) and "no analytics" (thus no `REACT_APP_FB_MEASUREMENT_ID`
variable later).

From your project, once you have created your Firestore Database and
your Firebase Web App, you'll have your own `firebaseConfig` data in hands.
Create a `.env.local` file using `.env` as example. Like doing this:

```sh
cp .env .env.local
```

So then open your `.env.local` and put your Firebase config data there. This file won't be versioned,
it's ignored by git, so you won't need to share your own data while contributing.

### Hosting local web app

Runs the app in the development mode:

```sh
npm start
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits. You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### Some more Firebase operations

A few more steps to finish your initial Firebase setup. In your Firebase Console:

1. Authentication -> Sign-in method: enable at least the "e-mail/password" mode, but Gmail and Facebook
   is also a possibility.
2. Cloud Firestore -> Rules: if you're planning to store real data,
   secure it with a few rules, otherwise just let reading/writing to be free/trusty.
3. While running the app, during your first queries, a few browser console errors may show up,
   requiring the creation of indexes on the database. Just follow the link provided by the
   warning (and wait a few minutes).

And, please, don't create accounts using this Console, but create your account only using
the real application form running locally.

## Contributing

Open [an issue](https://github.com/Mazuh/frifim/issues) describing how you're
planning to contribute, even plain ideas or clueless bug reports are very
good contributions. Then we can check the doable viability (cause Firebase
is nice and free but limited), before any hard work.

## Deploying

For service administrators. Make sure you have the correct environment variables for
prodcution, then prepare the static dist folder and publish it with Firebase CLI:

```js
npm install firebase-tools -g
firebase login
npm run build
firebase deploy
```

For code administrators, if everything worked fine with the build
and tests steps, remember to use `npm version x.y.z` where "x.y.z" is the
version number following [semantic versioning](https://semver.org/). Then
push this created tagged commit and write the changelog
on [release](https://github.com/Mazuh/frifim/releases) page.

## What does Frifim mean?

In a short answer: **fr**ee **i**ndependent **fi**nancial **m**anagement.

More importantly, it's a funny word available to be registered as a domain.

This "free" stands for the freedom of free source projects, but I'll also try
my best to keep it at no costs for end users, even when significant expenses appear.
